# Employee_Salary_Prediction
Employee Salary Prediction is a classic machine learning project, based on classification. This repository contains the data, code, application, as well as the documentation to classify salary of an individual in certain income slabs, based on the input.

The Employee_Salary_Prediction.ipynb file is the actual code in Jupyter Notebook. 
It also contains the application code using streamlit. The app.py file provides the application code separately.

The "Adult.csv" dataset has been borrowed from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. (Becker, B. & Kohavi, R. (1996). Adult [Dataset]. UCI Machine Learning Repository. https://doi.org/10.24432/C5XW20.)
