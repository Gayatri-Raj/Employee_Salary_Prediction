# Employee_Salary_Prediction
Employee Salary Prediction is a classic machine learning project, based on classification. This repository contains the data, code, as well as the documentation to classify salary of an individual in certain income slabs, based on the input.

The Employee_Salary_Prediction.ipynb file is the project in Jupyter Notebook. 
It also contains the application code using streamlit. 
An additional pyhton file "Machine_learning code" is also included which refers to the same code as that in the Jupyter NB, but saved as a .py file for easier access and execution.

The "Adult.csv" dataset has been borrowed from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. (Becker, B. & Kohavi, R. (1996). Adult [Dataset]. UCI Machine Learning Repository. https://doi.org/10.24432/C5XW20.)

This project helps in uncovering complex patterns in the income dataset, and reveals the important features affecting the income of individuals.
